# Simple Weather Web App

This is a simple weather web app. I used a public API from OpenWeather.

## To Run the Program:

1. Navigate to your project directory:
    ```sh
    cd your-project-directory
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the server:
    ```sh
    nodemon index.js
    ```

## Requirements:

- Node.js should be installed on your system.
